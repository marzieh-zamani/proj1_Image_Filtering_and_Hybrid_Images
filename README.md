# ENSE 885AY project 1: [Image Filtering and Hybrid Images]


# Project Review
- Project subject: Image Filtering and Hybrid Images

- Project objectives: Writing an image filtering function and using it to create hybrid images.


# Main files to check
- Project report: I have briefly introduced the objectives of the project, reviewed the image processing methods, explained the main functions, described experiments and discussed the results.

- Notebook: High level code where inputs are given, main functions are called, results are displayed and saved.

- Student code: Image processing functions are defined.


# Credits and References
This project has been developed based on the project template and high-level code provided by Dr. Kin-Choong Yow, my instructor for the course “ENSE 885AY: Application of Deep Learning in Computer Vision”.

This course is based on Georgia Tech’s CS 6476 Computer Vision course instructed by James Hays.
